		<h3>Rural customers who connected to the grid in 2009</h3>

		<p>The first block of text will desribe the 2009 data: consumption rises rapidly within the first few months of connection, then essentially plateaus after a household has been connected for two years.</p>

	<div class="chartChatter" id="chatter_2">
		
		<h3>Rural customers who connected to the grid in 2010-2015</h3>

		<p>Customers who have connected to the grid more recently have plateaued at diminishing levels of consumption.</p>
		<p>Two years after their initial connections, the median rural households that were connected in 2009 and 2010 were consistently consuming over 30 kilowatt-hours a month, yet the median households that were connected in 2011 and 2012 only consumed 25 kilowatt-hours a month after a similar period of access to electricity.</p>

		<p>Note how this pattern holds for upper-quartile households as well.</p>
